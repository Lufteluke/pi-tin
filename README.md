# Pi Tin

![](images/main.jpg)

Pi Tin is an open source retro gaming device designed around the Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W and a 2.8" 320x240 TFT display, the largest readily available size that will fit into an Altoids tin. The Pi Zero 2 W is capable of emulating most SNES, GBA, PS1, Genesis/Megadrive, and even some N64 games.

Pi Tin's gamepad uses the exact same Alps tactile switches and elastomer membrane design used in the Gameboy Advance SP and DSi to achieve superior button feel over designs using conductive rubber buttons or bare tactile switches. It features a soft power button to turn on or safely shut down the system with a single press, and is designed to be safe to use while charging and compatible with all USB-C cables and chargers. The battery lasts for up to 5 hours of gaming <small>(tested on 3D printed case option - 2000mAh battery)</small>.

Building a Pi Tin requires a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W, two custom PCBs, some 3D printed parts, and a few other components which are readily available from distributors. The PCBs require advanced soldering skills and ideally both a hot plate and hot air station to assemble by hand. We are working on making kits with assembled PCBs available to purchase.

Shown below are Rev. 2 PCBs, manufactured by [PCBWay](https://www.pcbway.com/). PCBWay reached out to sponsor this project and I was excited to work with them as I have used PCBWay before at work and have been consistently satisfied with their customization options, turnkey parts sourcing ability, and very responsive customer support. The quality of PCBs they delivered here was excellent as always.

*Note 2025-06-07: Main PCB files have been updated with the practice boards included in the kits. Display PCB files have been updated to revision 2a with minor component changes and brightness control support. Previous revision files are in the old folder.*

## build options

Pi Tin can either be built with a 3D printed clamshell case (93 x 66 x 26.5mm) or built to fit inside an Altoids tin.

The Altoids tin build option is more difficult than the 3D printed case option; it requires additional tools and experience using them. It has poor ergonomics due to the constraints of building inside an Altoids tin and the battery capacity is 40% lower than the 3D printed case version. We strongly recommend the 3D printed case option for these reasons.

**Important: Read through all the instructions thoroughly before building. This is an intermediate level project and we don't recommend attempting it without prior electronics kit building experience.**

Build instructions for both options start with the [hardware build guide](./hardware_build).

## mintypi disclaimer

We are aware of the existence of MintyPi; our main motivation for building this project was that MintyPi is no longer possible to build as it relies on proprietary parts that are not sold anymore. MintyPi was a closed-source commercial product and it was not released under a license limiting or requiring attribution for derivative works. The creators did not release a schematic of the custom PCBs or even documentation of what drivers/software were installed on their prebuilt SD card image.
